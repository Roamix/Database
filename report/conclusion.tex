The goal of the project was to generate a functioning database train 
management. We did this by first designing the database as en Entity Relation 
diagram. Once the diagram was finished it was translated into the MySQL EER 
diagram. However, at this point we realised flaws in the initial design, and an 
iterative process thereby began. One entity or relation was translated possibly 
redesigned translated again. Only once we were satisfied we moved on to the 
next relation/entity
