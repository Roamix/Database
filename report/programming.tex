\section{Database programming}\label{sec:prog}
This section deals with populating the database, updating and deleting existing 
entries, and finally some SQL programming.

\subsection{SQL Data Manipulation}
When inserting into the empty schema, it is necessary to insert cities as the 
first thing. Next is stations, followed by tracks, routes, trains, employees, 
etc. This is because of the relations and their total participation in each 
other. For example, a track can not exist without having a station in each 
end.
Also, when inserting data into a relation, the values of the insert statement 
of course has to correspond with the relation design on our ER diagram.\\
An example of inserting cities, would be done by statements like the following:

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{img/INSERT_Statements}
    \caption{SQL INSERT statements for City}
\end{figure}

It is now possible to insert stations located in the existing cities

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/INSERT_Statement_Station}
    \caption{SQL INSERT statements for Station}
\end{figure}

and then connect these stations with tracks.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/INSERT_Statements_Track}
    \caption{SQL INSERT statements for Track}
\end{figure}

Finally, we can now insert routes that are composed of existing tracks.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{img/INSERT_Statements_Route}
    \caption{SQL INSERT statements for Route}
\end{figure}

When routes have been inserted it is necessary to have a relation containing 
which tracks each route is composed of. This is the \emph{RouteTracks} 
relation, which we will insert into now.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{img/INSERT_Statements_RouteTracks}
    \caption{SQL INSERT statements for RouteTracks}
\end{figure}

We are now interested in having trains driving on these existing routes.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{img/INSERT_Statements_Train}
    \caption{SQL INSERT statements for Train}
\end{figure}

However, a train does not have to be on a route. Say, it could be at the 
workshop, but it is still an existing train.

There is of course employees driving and controlling these trains, so lets 
insert some employees

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/INSERT_Statements_Employee}
    \caption{SQL INSERT statements for Employee}
\end{figure}

An employee can have a workshift on a train, which is stored as a tuple in the 
\emph{Shift} relation.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{img/INSERT_Statements_Shift}
    \caption{SQL INSERT statements for Shift}
\end{figure}

When deleting tuples or dropping relations, the total participation of the 
relations comes into play again, just like when inserting into the schema.\\
In the \emph{Train Management} schema, the relations with total participation 
has been set to \emph{ON DELETE CASCADE}. So, if you were to delete a city 
which contained stations connected with tracks and routes, it would delete the 
routes, tracks and stations as well.\\

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/DELETE_Statements}
    \caption{SQL DELETE statements}
\end{figure}

Not having the relations set to \emph{ON DELETE CASCADE}, the relations would 
have to be deleted in the correct order, starting from the bottom of the above 
figure.
Updates do not cascade, as the primary keys and foreign keys of relations 
should never need to be changed/updated. ID's should always stay the same, so 
``should'' city names and stations names. If a route were to have its start or 
stop station changed, we would simply insert a new route, rather than updating 
the old.
There are still other attributes that are useful to update though, as seen in 
the examples below.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/UPDATE_Statements}
    \caption{SQL UPDATE statements}
\end{figure}

Some of the informations that should be retrieval according to the design, 
turned out to not be convenient to model directly, as for instance the length 
of a route. The entity \emph{Route} could have had an attribute with the length 
of the entire route, but this would be compromising the normalisations as the 
value should be calculated as the sum of lengths of all the tracks on the 
route. We therefore created the a view, that shows the length of all the 
tracks. The view, together with its implementation, can be seen in 
Figure~\ref{fig:length}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45 \textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/RouteLengths}
        \caption{Implementation of the view}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45 \textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics{img/RouteLengthsView}
        \caption{Selecting everything from the view}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{View for finding the lengths of all routes}
    \label{fig:length}
\end{figure}

Having implemented the first view we proceeded to implement views to get all 
the stations on a certain route. However, this turned out to be a fencepost 
problem, since we get the stations on the route, through the \emph{Track} 
entity. By selecting either the \emph{FromStation} or the \emph{ToStation} from 
all the tracks on the route, we would be missing either the first or the last 
station. We instead chose to select both and thus have a table of tracks 
(defined by pairs of stations), rather than stations. An example of this can be 
seen in Figure~\ref{fig:route}. Here the result is ordered by the attribute 
\emph{Number} which assures the tracks are listed in proper order (assuming of 
course that these numbers have been set properly). These two views can be used 
as if they were tables in further SQL statements. This can for instance be used 
to naturally join the view \emph{RouteLengths} with the table \emph{Routes}, 
thus adding a column with the routes length to the \emph{Routes} table. The 
column is of course only added in the result of the query and not actually 
added to the table, as that would be undesirable. This means that if a track on 
the a route changes length, then so does the length of the route, as long as 
the view is recomputed.


\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45 \textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/TracksOnRoute}
        \caption{Implementation of the view}
    \end{subfigure}
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45 \textwidth}
        \centering

        \caption{Selecting everything from the view}
    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{View of all tracks on route 2}
    \label{fig:route}
\end{figure}

\subsection{SQL Programming}
To control the data integrity and make insertion easier and less trivial or 
calculating attributes, a couple of functions, triggers, procedures, 
transactions and events have been programmed and implemented.

Each station has a specific capacity, that is amount of lanes. And, to make 
sure that no more tracks are connected to a station than there is capacity, a 
trigger has been implemented to prevent insertion.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/SQL_TRIGGER}
    \caption{SQL Trigger}
\end{figure}

For example, if Station A has 2 lanes, which is equals to 4 tracks (For each 
lane there is 1 ingoing track and 1 outgoing), then the trigger would throw an 
error 1644, and prevent insertion of connecting a fifth track to Station A.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/SQL_TRIGGER_example}
    \caption{SQL Trigger example}
\end{figure}

Lejre st has 2 lanes and already had 4 tracks connected (2 tracks for each 
connected city), so trying to connect a fifth resulted in an error from the 
Trigger which triggers \emph{BEFORE INSERT}.

A couple of functions has also been implemented. These are primarily used to 
calculate dynamic attributes for the relations.
This is used calculating the length of a route

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/SQL_FUNCTION_Length}
    \caption{SQL Function for Track Length}
\end{figure}

A function for calculating the age of a train.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/SQL_FUNCTION_Age}
    \caption{SQL Function for Train Age}
\end{figure}

Next up is the implemented procedures. Some of the procedures only reads from 
the tables, while other procedures also performs data manipulation.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/SQL_PROCEDURE_Neighbours}
    \caption{SQL Procedure for finding Station neighbours}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/SQL_PROCEDURE_ConnectParallel}
    \caption{SQL Procedure for connecting stations parallel both ways}
\end{figure}

The procedure inputs 0 to the ID's of the tracks, because our ID's 
automatically increments from the newest ID.

In this last procedure, a transaction has been included. This is to make sure, 
that the city and station do not get inserted unless it is possible to connect 
it to the targeted station.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/SQL_PROCEDURE_AddCityConnect}
    \caption{SQL Procedure for connecting new city to target city}
\end{figure}

The procedure adds a new city to the database, creates the main station for the 
city, and connects it to the specified existing target city, with a specified 
distance, by adding tracks between them.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/SQL_PROCEDURE_AddCityConnect_example}
    \caption{Before and after the above procedure}
\end{figure}

The only event, is really not a required functionality, as our \emph{Train 
Management} schema really has no need of events in its current state. 

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{img/SQL_EVENT}
    \caption{SQL Event for finding todays employees}
\end{figure}

This event tells who is at work everyday.
The implemented event, is more for general managing, as it is nice to know for 
each day of the week what employees are at work.
